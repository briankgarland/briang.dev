With Jamstack, the entire front end is prebuilt into highly optimized static pages and assets during a build process. This process of pre-rendering results in sites which can be served directly from a [CDN](https://jamstack.org/glossary/cdn/), reducing the cost, complexity and risk, of dynamic servers as critical infrastructure.

With so many popular tools for generating sites, like [Gatsby](https://jamstack.org/generators/gatsby/), [Hugo](https://jamstack.org/generators/hugo/), [Jekyll](https://jamstack.org/generators/jekyll/), [Eleventy](https://jamstack.org/generators/eleventy/), [NextJS](https://jamstack.org/generators/next/), [and very many more](https://jamstack.org/generators/), many web developers are already familiar with the tools needed to become productive Jamstack developers.
